A few GitHub rules:
Keep file paths short and sensible.
Don’t use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
If using rstudio, always pull before you start working on your project and before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn’t want anyone’s work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.
If you intend to push commited changes to GitHub, if using Bash, before you pull, first fetch.  
 - git fetch  #
 - git status #
 - git pull #
 - git origin master push
