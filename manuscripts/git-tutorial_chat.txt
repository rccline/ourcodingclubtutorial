	I don't see dii as well
08:26:09 From  Jessica Mundy  to  Everyone:
	I use Git through the terminal, and you usually need to do ‚Äúgit add‚Äù before you commit. Do you need to do this if you use the RStudio Git?
08:26:17 From  GaoYu  to  Everyone:
	just RStudio
08:26:22 From  chaoyan  to  Everyone:
	yes

	Tutorial Link: https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/git/
08:31:35 From  Jessica Mundy  to  Everyone:
	I had a question which I posted previously, just wondered if it sent!
08:32:18 From  Jessica Mundy  to  Everyone:
	Ok great thanks!
08:36:16 From  Bernard Forgues  to  Everyone:
	Terminal apparently stuck at ‚ÄúUpdating Homebrew‚Ä¶‚Äù Is there something I‚Äôm supposed to do?
08:39:33 From  Diana Jerome  to  Everyone:
	if it does get stuck again this webpage had a potential solution to a similar problem https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/895
08:41:43 From  Rebecca Rau  to  Everyone:
	Can you change your github name if you don't like it anymore?
08:42:26 From  Rebecca Rau  to  Everyone:
	okay, cool. Thank you!

08:43:05 From  Jer√≥nimo Cid  to  Everyone:
	Is there a way to bring your other repositories into the one we just created, ie change repository structure?
08:43:38 From  Jer√≥nimo Cid  to  Everyone:
	the later
08:44:10 From  Jer√≥nimo Cid  to  Everyone:
	Thanks!
08:44:40 From  Donncha Mullin  to  Everyone:
	thanks, and what about bringing (already existing) folders from my computer into github?
08:46:37 From  Donncha Mullin  to  Everyone:
	cool, thanks will give that a go later and get in touch if it‚Äôs not working for me
08:48:47 From  Rebecca Rau  to  Everyone:
	should something happen after you typed "brew install git"? üòÖ
08:51:21 From  Diana Jerome  to  Everyone:
	To check whether or not you have git installed type "git --version" into your terminal, but it also might just be slow
08:52:40 From  Rebecca Rau  to  Everyone:
	cool, it was slow but it worked!
08:52:52 From  Joseph Everest  to  Everyone:
	Excellent! :)
09:00:36 From  Sara Villa  to  Everyone:
	I'm having troubles cloning my repository to my local PC to open in R studio. Does it affect that I'm trying to use a OneDrive folder the local folder?
09:01:34 From  Sara Villa  to  Everyone:
	just authentication error
09:01:47 From  Jessica Mundy  to  Everyone:
	I had nightmares working with onedrive and GitHub. I would recommend keeping your git repository on your hard drive
09:01:52 From  Sara Villa  to  Everyone:
	let me copy, one sec
09:02:46 From  Sara Villa  to  Everyone:

09:02:58 From  Donncha Mullin  to  Everyone:
	So probably same issue if I use Dropbox?
09:03:01 From  Ana Filipa Sobral  to  Everyone:
	Is there a space limit on GitHub?
09:03:49 From  Sara Villa  to  Everyone:
	got it, thanks!
09:04:00 From  Guillemette  to  Everyone:
	There is a space limit on GitHub yes, let me find how much it is exactly - but from what I remember it is quite large and hard to reach if you do basic data analysis projects
09:04:23 From  Donncha Mullin  to  Everyone:
	My commit of existing folders and files from my Dropbox is failing. Is there a limit on how much I can upload at one time? Maybe it‚Äôs the Dropbox issue
09:05:14 From  Guillemette  to  Everyone:
	internet says, maximum individual repository size limit of 10 GB
09:05:18 From  Ana Filipa Sobral  to  Everyone:
	Thank you!
09:06:20 From  Guillemette  to  Everyone:
	oups 100 GB * actually
09:06:33 From  Rebecca Rau  to  Everyone:
	How do you write in bold in your README.md?
09:06:58 From  Donncha Mullin  to  Everyone:
	Okay, cool thanks. It worked for me when I tried commiting just one folder there but will try multiple folders once I move them from Dropbox
09:07:29 From  Guillemette  to  Everyone:
	‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôwrite something here'''
09:08:12 From  Joseph Everest  to  Everyone:
	https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf
09:08:29 From  Guillemette  to  Everyone:
	actually you can either use **insert text** or __insert text__
09:08:31 From  Joseph Everest  to  Everyone:
	^^ Cheat sheet for formatting READMEs and RMarkdown documents
09:08:31 From  Bernard Forgues  to  Everyone:
	I‚Äôm at 3. Sync and interact‚Ä¶ and I got an error message from RStudio:‚Ä®>>>‚Ä®Cloning into 'codingClub'...	remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.

09:08:57 From  Rebecca Rau  to  Everyone:
	Thank you!
09:10:31 From  steve bachman  to  Everyone:
	from limited experience of all this, I can back up the comment on one drive syncing. It has caused problems for me. working off local/hard drive with no problems.
09:11:42 From  Diana Jerome  to  Everyone:
	I would just try pushing it
09:14:23 From  Sara Villa  to  Everyone:
	OK, so my problem now is that I have nowhere where to put the personal token. It only gives me the option of username and Pw to authenticate... :(
09:15:08 From  Sara Villa  to  Everyone:
	shall I try the troubleshooting with R bit in the tutorial?
09:15:33 From  Sara Villa  to  Everyone:
	ok, coming, ta!
09:15:50 From  Bernard Forgues  to  Everyone:
	So I‚Äôve created and copied the access token and in Step 2, it says ‚Äúyou should get a prompt‚Äù but I don‚Äôt?
09:17:14 From  Sara Villa  to  Everyone:
	yesssssss!!! it worked!!! thanks a lot!!!
09:17:49 From  Guillemette  to  Everyone:
	yayyy! No worries :))
09:19:57 From  Bernard Forgues  to  Everyone:
	Phew! It worked! Thanks again.
09:20:15 From  Guillemette  to  Everyone:
	Ah, good !
09:24:38 From  Donncha Mullin  to  Everyone:
	Sorry I‚Äôve not reached the same error as Bernard earlier. Wasn‚Äôt listening to the solution then as was doing battle with folder commiting! What is the solution? error message: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.

09:24:47 From  Donncha Mullin  to  Everyone:
	*now reached
09:32:04 From  Bernard Forgues  to  Everyone:
	I had the same problem. What I was missing is the checkbox in the pop-up window called ‚ÄúReview Changes"
09:34:25 From  Christian Rixen  to  Everyone:
	GIT was not detected from my R studio although I have it installed
09:35:10 From  Guillemette  to  Everyone:
	So all your installation process occurred normally?
09:35:21 From  Kate  to  Everyone:
	what does this mean?
09:35:23 From  Kate  to  Everyone:
	Now the folder has been made into a Git repository, allowing you to track changes to files. Now, lets create a README.md file inside the repository and put some text in it, using whatever text editor you are comfortable with. Make sure to place this README.md file into the repository folder on your device so it can be found!
09:36:18 From  Kate  to  Everyone:
	how do I create a readme.md file inside the repository?
09:36:54 From  Christian Rixen  to  Everyone:
	have got to go. Thanks!!!
09:37:11 From  Joseph Everest  to  Everyone:
	Hi Christian, have you tried to clone your repository to RStudio?
09:37:39 From  Joseph Everest  to  Everyone:
	Ah you have to head away! That may be the solution to your issue. Thanks for joining!
09:37:43 From  Kate  to  Everyone:
	a new file in rstudio or on my laptop
09:40:40 From  Anna Aitken  to  Everyone:
	You create the files with these commands: 	touch README.md	touch .gitignore	touch test.R
09:40:59 From  Diana Jerome  to  Everyone:
	touch README.md
09:41:10 From  Diana Jerome  to  Everyone:
	will make the readme
09:41:32 From  Diana Jerome  to  Everyone:
	git add README.md will then add it to the repository
09:41:41 From  Kate  to  Everyone:
	ok thanks
09:41:42 From  Anna Aitken  to  Everyone:
